    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "We have seen in the [FMP notebook on nonnegative matrix factorization](../C8/C8S3_NMFbasic.html) how the NMF algorithm can be used to approximate a magnitude spectrogram of a given audio recording by a product of two nonnegative matrices. Intuitively, the first matrix represents the various spectral patterns (musical pitches) that occur in a recording, while the second matrix exhibits the time points where these spectral patterns are active. Generally, the factorization obtained from NMF has now direct semantical interpretation. In the following, we show how one can successively incorporate musical information (e.g., as specified by a score representation) to obtain a decomposition of the audio signal into musically meaningful sound events. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let us start with an individual note played on a piano, which corresponds to a time&ndash;frequency pattern. Intuitively, this pattern may be described by a spectral vector that has a pitch-dependent harmonic structure and some time-dependent weights that describe the sound's volume over time. Playing several notes, the resulting audio recording may be regarded as a superposition of the sound events that correspond to the individual notes. Even though this model is too simplistic to correctly reflect all acoustic properties of the music recording, it justifies applying the NMF framework. In order to decompose the given music signal $x$, we apply NMF to the [magnitude of the STFT](../C2/C2_STFT-Basic.html) $\\mathcal{X}$. More precisely, we use the transposed version, yielding a nonnegative $(K\\times N)$ matrix \n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "    V:=|\\mathcal{X}|^\\top.\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "In the factorization $V \\approx W \\cdot H$, we expect that the template matrix $W$ picks up the structure of the pitch-dependent spectral vectors, while the activation matrix $H$ encodes when and how strongly the respective vectors are active. In this way, the matrix $H$ yields a kind of weighted piano-roll representation for the notes' templates. For this kind of interpretation, the rank parameter $R$ should correspond to the number of different pitches occurring in the piece of music. "

    "As demonstrated by this example, there are various issues with this approach. Looking at the learned template matrix $W$, it is not clear to which sound or pitch a given template corresponds. While only a few of the template vectors reveal a clear harmonic structure, most of the templates seem to correspond to mixtures of notes rather than individual notes. This is also indicated by the activation patterns in $H$, which can hardly be associated to a piano-roll representation of the score. In summary, even though the original matrix $V$ may be approximated well, simply applying the standard NMF approach based on a random initialization often produces a factorization that lacks clear musical semantics."

In this context, the multiplicative update rules again constitute a great advantage over additive rules. In the multiplicative case, zero-valued entries remain so during the entire learning process. Thanks to this property, one can enforce certain structures on $W$ and $H$ by setting suitable entries to zero in the initialization stage. Using this modified initialization, one can then apply the [standard NMF approach](../C8/C8S3_NMFbasic.html) in the subsequent learning process.\n",

One can also refine the initialization of the templates using instrument-dependent harmonic models, which may be derived from example recordings of isolated notes.

Assuming that the note events specified by the score are aligned to the time positions where they occur in the audio recording, one can impose time constraints on where certain templates may become active. To this end, one initializes suitable regions in $H^{(0)}$ by setting the corresponding activation entries to one. The remaining entries are set to zero. Such a score-informed initialization is used in the following figure.

    "To account for possible alignment inaccuracies, the temporal boundaries for the constraint regions can be chosen in a rather generous fashion. As a result, the activation matrix $H$ can be interpreted as a coarse piano-roll representation of the synchronized score information. In a sense, the synchronization step can be seen as yielding a first approximate factorization, which is then refined by the NMF-based learning procedure. As expected, combining the activation constraints with those for the template vectors further stabilizes the factorization in the sense that the result better reflects the desired semantics."

    "## Onset Model\n",
    "\n",
    "So far, the NMF-based decomposition only represents harmonic properties of the signal. To also account for percussive properties such as onsets, we now show how one may extend the NMF model by introducing additional templates. A first idea is to use one additional template that jointly explains the onsets for all pitches. However, since the spectral patterns for note onsets may not be completely independent from the respective pitch (as is the case with the piano), we use in the following one additional **onset template** for **each pitch**. In general, it is hard to predict the spectral shape of an onset template.  Therefore, in contrast to the harmonic templates, we do not enforce any spectral constraints, but initialize the onset templates uniformly and let the learning process derive their respective shapes. While it is hard to find meaningful spectral constraints for the onset templates, the **short-time nature of note onsets** makes it possible to introduce relatively **strict temporal constraints** on the activation side. Using the synchronized score information, one has a rough estimate for the onset positions. Within a small neighborhood around each of these positions (accounting for possible synchronization inaccuracies), we initialize the corresponding activation entries with one, while setting all remaining entries to zero. This strongly constrains the time points where onset templates are allowed to become active. In the following example, we use such an extended NMF model with initializations on the template and activation side.\n",

    "As illustrated by the figure, the learned **harmonic templates** have a much cleaner harmonic structure compared with the ones in previous factorizations. The reason is that most of the transients' broadband energy is now captured by the **onset templates**. Furthermore, one can observe an impulse-like activation pattern at the beginning of note events for most of the onset templates. This indicates that these templates indeed represent onsets. Having a closer look at the onset templates, one can observe a spread of energy across many different spectral coefficients. Often, the spread is concentrated in regions around the fundamental frequency and the first harmonic."

    "In summary, we have seen that a combination of template and activation constraints may significantly stabilize and guide an NMF-based factorization process to yield a musically meaningful decomposition. In this process, constraints on the activation side can compensate for using relatively loose or even no constraints on the template side and vice versa. We close this notebook with some final remarks.\n",

    "* Note that the constraints introduced are hard in the sense that zero entries in $W^{(0)}$ and $H^{(0)}$ **remain zero** throughout the learning process. Therefore, one should use rather generous constraint regions to account for potential synchronization inaccuracies and to retain a certain degree of flexibility. \n",
    "\n",
    "* We want to emphasize that using hard constraints by setting certain coefficients to zero allows for using exactly the same **multiplicative update rules** as in standard NMF. Thus the constrained procedure inherits the **ease of implementation** and **computational efficiency** of the original approach. This is one of the most advantageous aspects of using NMF."
